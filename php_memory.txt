give more memory to php in docker container

@bitdegree67
You can change it with
echo 'memory_limit = 512M' >> /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-memlimit.ini;
inside the docker container
but i think its temporary and hacky




access docker container
docker exec -it <mycontainer> bash

I could accomplish the same thing by running:

$ docker exec -it d2d4a89aaee9 ip addr
